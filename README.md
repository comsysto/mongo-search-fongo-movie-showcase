Mongo Search Fongo Movie Showcase
==========

Our movie playground application for comSysto Blog (http://blog.comsysto.com) entries.

It uses Spring, Apache Wicket, Gradle and Mongo to demonstrate how to use
the new Mongo DB full text search feature and
Fongo for Mongo in-memory testing.

TODO: can we distribute the 99992movies.json file in repositoy/src/main/resources?

Please mail comments to Christian.Kroemer@comsysto.com or Elisabeth.Engel@comsysto.com!
